# holbertonschool-binary_trees
## holbertonschool-binary_trees directoray was created for 0x1D. C - Binary trees project

### Project general information
This project contains functions to help build; delete; calculate depth, hegith, size;
go through the Binary Tree using traversal orders and so on
